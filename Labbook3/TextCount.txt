In the novel ‘A Thousand Splendid Suns’ by Khaled Hosseini and the play ‘A Doll’s House’ by Henrik Ibsen, It could be argued the representation of women is a recurring theme that is presented in patriarchal societies in the two texts. Arguably, women in both texts face obstacles that disempower and silence them due to men’s treatment of women, the societal view of women, and the oppression and objectification of women. I believe women’s ability to overcome this disempowerment is particularly challenging due to being oppressed by men. ‘A thousand splendid suns’ is a post-modern text set from the early 1960s to the early 2000’s suns represent women in Afghanistan In the 1960s when some of the biggest strides were made towards a more liberal and westernized lifestyle whilst still trying to maintain a respect for more conservative factions. ‘A Doll’s House’ on the other hand, was set in the 1870s, in the Victorian era, where the distinctions between men and women and their gender roles became more sharply evident than ever before.
